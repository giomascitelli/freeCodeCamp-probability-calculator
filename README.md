# Probability Calculator

This is the final project that I completed as part of the 'Scientific Computing with Python' course from freeCodeCamp. For this project, I worked on Replit using their test code to develop a class and a function. The Hat class takes a variable number of arguments that specify the number of balls of each color inside the hat. The arguments passed into the Hat are converted into a list, showing the color name and the corresponding number of balls inside the hat.

The Hat class also has a method called 'draw', which accepts an argument indicating the number of balls to draw from the hat. This method randomly removes balls from the list and returns those balls as a list of strings.

The experiment function accepts several variables to calculate the probability of a specific experiment occurring based on the number of balls inside the hat.
